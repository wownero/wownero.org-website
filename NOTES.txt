-If you could make the splash image, the 3d render of the WOWNERO logo, bounce up and down while leaving the shadow static that'd be amazing

-Not sure how to do the Team/Advisors/Visionary layout super well. Names under the circle image are fine so is rollover img to reveal name.

-I don't have all the team photos yet if you could just make it a circle place holder with the outline colors I designated in the layout pdf I'd appreciate it.

-If you need me to dig out the reddit/discord/twitter logos and such let me know. 

-If any of my information is incorrect or you need to grab a link or image the current website is at http://wownero.org

-Use whatever font, spacing, colors, and sizing you feel best. You're a great web dev and I differ to your judgement. Keeping the font a serif is all I ask.

-ABOUT should go to the second section... RESOURCES should go to the github links and such... TEAM should go to the team section... Community should go to the twitter/reddit links.
